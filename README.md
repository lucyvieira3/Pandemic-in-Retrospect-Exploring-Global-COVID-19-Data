APPROACH AND ANALYSIS
1. First I cleaned out the data and divided it into two worksheets as Total Deaths and Total Vaccinations to create my database. 
2. I calculated the total death percentage and highest infection count based on the data by location.
3. To calculate the Percentage of population infected I joined both of the total deaths and total vaccinations table with the new updated data.
4. Exported the data for visualization purposes on tableau as follow.
